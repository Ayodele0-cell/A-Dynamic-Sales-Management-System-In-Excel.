# A Dynamic Sales Management System In Excel

Welcome to my Excel-powered sales analytics project!

This project simulates a real-world retail sales operation where customer orders are recorded via a user-friendly sales form. From the moment a sale is entered, every part of the workbook updates automatically ‚Äî from KPIs and sales tracking per retail outlet, to customer behavior analytics and delivery performance analysis. All of this is built in Microsoft Excel with automation via VBA (macros), dynamic formulas, pivot tables, and dashboards.

## Why This Project?

As a Certified Accounting Technician and aspiring data analyst, I developed this Excel-based solution to:

- Automate sales tracking across multiple branches and sales reps  
- Use Excel to deliver interactive business intelligence without third-party tools  
- Analyze delivery performance and customer satisfaction via order status metrics  
- Improve my ability to design integrated Excel systems for real-world business decisions

### Phase 5: Delivery Time vs Order Status (Analysis Sheet)

**Goal:** Determine if **delivery time** affects whether an order is **Completed or Returned**.

| Analysis Done                         | Description                                              |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| **Delivery Duration Calculation**     | Based on time between sale and actual delivery           |
| **Average Delivery Time by Status**   | Compares Completed vs Returned orders                    |
| **Status Segmentation by Time Range** | Bins delivery times to explore correlations              |
| **Visual Analysis (Charts)**          | Bar/line graphs comparing delay groups with return rates |

## Using T-test:T-Test: Two-Sample Assuming Unequal Variances
- Developed null Hypothesis (H‚ÇÄ): Delivery time does not influence order status &
- Alternative Hypothesis (H‚ÇÅ): Orders with longer delivery times are more likely to be returned.

In overall, the descriptive analysis and t-test revealed that a quantitative relationship exists between delivery time and customer satisfaction, measured by whether the order is returned. As a result, actionable operational insights were obtained which would be implemented in order to reduce return rates and improve customer experience.

**Key Insight:** Longer delivery times tend to have higher return rates ‚Äî highlighting areas for operational improvement.
